# Face Detector

This is my final project for the Web Development course form ZTM.
The app consumes Clarifai API for face detection. The user is able to upload pictures from local folders and by pasting URL.
The backend's been developed with NodeJs and the server with Express. Postegres database has been used for storing user's profile data and login.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
