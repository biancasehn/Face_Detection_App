# Face Detector

This is a face detector app :alien:, which was my final project for the Web Development course from ZTM (2020).

Feedbacks are more than welcome! :smile:

## Functionality
In the input field, the user will either:
* copy and paste the URL of their picture, or
* browse their pictures in their local folders. </br>
The user can also subscribe with their email and a password. Doing so, they will be able to keep track of their successful face detections.

## Stack
The app consumes [Clarifai API](https://docs.clarifai.com/) for face detection.
* Backend: Nodejs, Express, Postgres database, NextAuth.
* Frontend: Nextjs, CSS </br>

</br>
</br>
</br>
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
